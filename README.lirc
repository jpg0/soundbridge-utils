Copy or symlink the remote config, Sony-RMT-AA400U.lircd.conf, into
/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/ and (optionally?) disable any existing
devinput.lircd.conf that's there.

Make sure that you're using

  driver = irtoy

in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf.

Restart lircd and then try sending an IR message with, e.g.:

    irsend send_once Sony-RMT-AA400U VOLUME_UP
