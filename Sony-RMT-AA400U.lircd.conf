# These twenty bit codes are really comprised of three subcodes:
#
#   1. a 7-bit command code
#   2. a 5-bit device code
#   3. an 8-bit extended code
#
# They're transmitted with the least-significant bit first, but the REVERSE
# flag reorders them to be most-significant bit first with the extended code
# at the start instead of end.

# Timings in µs from the righto.com reference below.  Each code is transmitted
# a minimum of three times, or repeated twice (even for a single button press).
# Each transmission is a constant 45ms long; the gap of no IR activity between
# transmissions is variable and depends on the length of the code.  These are
# the spec values; irrecord will measure these timings slightly differently
# (including between runs!), but that's ok.

# The binary codes are formatted into their subcodes as
#
#   0b<extended>_<device>_<command>
# 
# with the most-significant bits first.  The codes are actually transmitted by
# the physical remote in reverse order, with the command code and
# least-significant bits first.
#
# The hex codes actually used by LIRC are equal to the binary values.  Python's
# builtin conversion functions and numeric literal syntax are handy for
# converting:
#
#   >>> bin(0x0181d)
#   '0b1100000011101'
#   >>> hex(0b00000001_10000_0011101)
#   '0x181d'
